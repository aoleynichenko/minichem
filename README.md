# minichem
A very simple quantum chemistry program.

Minichem is a tiny educational project, created in order to better understand the computational methods of quantum chemistry. I will improve it while studying new methods.
For details, see A. Szabo, N. Ostlund, "Modern Quantim Chemistry", and T. Helgaker, P. Jorgensen, J. Olsen, "Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory". All example calculations were validated using NWChem.

Features:
 - Single-point energy calculation;
 - RHF and UHF methods;
 - DIIS convergence acceleration algorithm;
 - OpenMP parallelization (not yet implemented in C++ version);
 - Available elements: all periodic table (but only non-relativistic treatment is available!);
 - Available basis sets: cartesian and spherical with L up to g-functions;
 - Tiny basis set library (adopted from EMSL [1,2]).

Possibilities to be implemented in the future:
 - DIIS implementation for UHF;
 - More scalable OpenMP parallelization;
 - Analytic gradients and geometry optimization;
 - Projection population analysis;
 - Molecular symmetry;
 - I want to try to implement also four-index transformation and MP2

Required tools:
 - C compilers (GNU or Intel)
 - CMake and make

Required libraries:
 - libc
 - MPI
 - BLAS/LAPACK and CBLAS/LAPACKE (C wrappers for their routines)
 - OpenMP (optional)

How to compile: <br>
 $ mkdir build && cd build <br>
 $ cmake .. <br>
 $ make [-jN] <br>

For suggestions and questions, alexvoleynichenko@gmail.com, I look forward to any comments!
