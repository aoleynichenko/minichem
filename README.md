# minichem
A very simple quantum chemistry program.

Minichem is a tiny educational project, created in order to better understand the computational methods of quantum chemistry. I will improve it while studying new methods.
For details, see A. Szabo, N. Ostlund, "Modern Quantim Chemistry", and T. Helgaker, P. Jorgensen, J. Olsen, "Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory". All example calculations were validated using NWChem.

Features:
 - Single-point energy calculation;
 - RHF and UHF methods;
 - DIIS convergence acceleration algorithm;
 - OpenMP parallelization;
 - Available elements: H-Ne;
 - Available basis sets: any basis sets with only s and p functions;
 - NWChem input file format.
 
Possibilities to be implemented in the future:
 - DIIS implementation for UHF;
 - More scalable OpenMP parallelization;
 - Analytic gradients and geometry optimization;
 - I want to try to implement four-index transformation, MP2, CISD, CCSD and CCSD(T) energies, CISD transition dipole moments, EOM-CCSD.
 
How to compile: <br>
 $ cd src <br>
 $ make <br>
 $ make install <br>
To compile project, you must have any MPI implementation (I use openmpi on my laptop) and gcc compiler.
In addition, you must have any implementation of LAPACK on your computer, see src/Makefile for details.

How to uninstall: <br>
 $ cd src <br>
 $ make uninstall <br>
